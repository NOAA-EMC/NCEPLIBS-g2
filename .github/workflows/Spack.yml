# This is a CI workflow for the NCEPLIBS-g2 project.
#
# This workflow builds g2 with Spack, including installing with the "--test
# root" option to run the CTest suite. It also has a one-off job that validates
# the recipe by ensuring that every CMake option that should be set in the
# Spack recipe is so set.
